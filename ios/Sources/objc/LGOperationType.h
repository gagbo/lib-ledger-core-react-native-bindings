/**
 * Type of operation.
 *
 * Itâ€™s possible to either
 * send funds (getAmount() returns the sent amount),
 * receive funds (getAmount() returns the sent amount),
 * delegate funds (getAmount() returns the *delegated* amount) ; only getFees() are part of balanceHistory
 * undelegate funds (getAmount() returns the *undelegated* amount) ; only getFees() are part of balanceHistory
 * claim rewards (getAmount() returns 0 or the known amount of claimed rewards) ; only getFees() are part of balanceHistory
 *
 * *other* : None operation type should be used when the operation is not expected to affect the balanceHistory of the
 *           account. Otherwise, this is a free for all. Clients can use the inflated Operation currency-specific
 *           API to correctly interpret the operation in the context of an account.
 *
 * The last 3 operations should not expect to change balanceHistory with their amount, but only their fees.
